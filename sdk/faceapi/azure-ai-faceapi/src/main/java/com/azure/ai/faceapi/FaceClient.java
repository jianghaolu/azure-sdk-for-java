     * Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/detectwithurl), which will expire 24

     * celebrity-looking faces. &lt;br/&gt;The 'recognitionModel' associated with the query face's faceId should be the
     * same as the 'recognitionModel' used by the target faceId array, face list or large face list.
